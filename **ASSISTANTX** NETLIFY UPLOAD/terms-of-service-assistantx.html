        <p class="mb-4">Welcome to AssistantX! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the AssistantX website, platform, and services (collectively, the "Service"), operated by AssistantX ("AssistantX," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Please read these Terms carefully before using our Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>AssistantX is a no-code platform that allows users to build and deploy custom AI agents ("Agents"). These Agents can be trained on your specific data to engage with your customers, answer questions, generate leads, and provide 24/7 support. The Service enables you to build a single AI Agent that can be embedded on websites or shared via a unique link on platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, email, and more.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. User Accounts</h2>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. User Data and Content ("Knowledge Base")</h2>
