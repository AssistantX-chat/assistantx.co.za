        <p>Like most websites, the AssistantX website automatically collects certain information and stores it in log files. This information may include:</p>

        <p>AssistantX has a legitimate interest in understanding how users engage with our website, which helps us offer more relevant products and services and effectively communicate value to our partners and customers.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>AssistantX provides a detailed Cookie Notice explaining the cookies and tracking technologies used on our website and how users can manage them.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>The personal information collected by AssistantX is stored in databases hosted by third parties in the United States. These third parties do not access or use your personal information except for limited storage and retrieval purposes. Occasionally, AssistantX engages third parties to send information to you about our products, services, and events.</p>
        <p>We do not disclose your personal data to any external parties for their independent use unless:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <li>You request or authorize it.</li>
          <li>It pertains to AssistantX-hosted or co-sponsored events.</li>
          <li>We are compelled to comply with legal obligations (e.g., law enforcement requests).</li>
          <li>It is provided to our agents or service providers performing functions on our behalf.</li>
          <li>It is necessary for emergencies or acts of God.</li>
          <li>It is required to address disputes or claims, or to authorized representatives acting on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">We may also collect aggregated data about our services and website visitors and disclose this aggregated (and therefore non-personally identifiable) information to partners or third parties for marketing or analytical purposes.</p>
        <p>The AssistantX website may connect with third-party services like Facebook and LinkedIn. If you share information through these services, we encourage you to review their privacy policies. If you are a member of these services, they may link your visit to our site with your personal data on their platform.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Transferring Personal Data to the U.S.</h2>
        <p>The information we collect about you will be processed in the United States. By using AssistantX’s services, you consent to this processing. The U.S. has not received an adequacy finding from the European Union under GDPR Article 45. To comply with GDPR Article 46, AssistantX provides appropriate safeguards by entering into binding data protection clauses (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) that are enforceable by data subjects in the EEA and the UK.</p>
        <p>In certain circumstances, AssistantX also collects and transfers personal data with your consent, to fulfil a contract with you, or to pursue a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your rights. We strive to implement suitable safeguards to protect your data and to use it in line with your relationship with AssistantX and our privacy practices. We enter into data processing agreements and model clauses with our vendors when appropriate. Since our inception, we have not received any government requests for information.</p>
